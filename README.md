# RMG Production Analytics Dashboard (TMS + GMS)

## Overview

This project showcases an interactive **RMG (Ready‑Made Garments) Production Analytics Dashboard** developed using **Power BI**, combining insights from **Textile Management System (TMS)** and **Garments Management System (GMS)** data. The dashboard provides end‑to‑end visibility into production performance, quality metrics, efficiency, and shipment reliability across the apparel manufacturing process.

---

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this dashboard is to help factory managers, production planners, and business stakeholders:

* Monitor overall production output and efficiency
* Track quality performance and rejection patterns
* Identify production loss, reprocessing, and delays
* Support data‑driven decisions to improve productivity and delivery timelines

---

## Tech Stack

* **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX calculations, interactive dashboards
* **Power Query** – Data cleaning, transformation, and integration
* **Excel / CSV** – Source data format
* **Manufacturing KPIs** – Efficiency, Yield, Pass Rate, Reprocessing Rate

---

## Data Source

* Simulated / Sample RMG production data
* Systems covered:

  * **TMS (Textile Management System)**
  * **GMS (Garments Management System)**
* Dataset includes:

  * Knitting output (KG)
  * Inspection pass & rejection data
  * Dyeing production & reprocessing
  * Cutting, marker efficiency, batch loss
  * Factory‑wise production and lost minutes
  * Shipment mode & on‑time delivery indicators
  * Time dimensions (Year, Month)

> Note: This dashboard uses sample data for learning and portfolio demonstration purposes.

## Business Problem

RMG factories generate large volumes of production and quality data across multiple processes. Without a centralized analytical view, it becomes difficult to:

* Track efficiency losses and quality issues
* Compare factory‑wise performance
* Identify causes of production delays and reprocessing
* Ensure on‑time shipment and optimal resource utilization

---

## Dashboard Goals

* Provide a single performance view across TMS & GMS systems
* Monitor production efficiency, yield, and inspection pass rates
* Identify rejection, reprocessing, and batch loss trends
* Analyze factory‑wise productivity and downtime
* Support operational decisions to improve output and delivery performance

---

## Key Dashboard Features / Highlights

* KPI cards for knitting output, efficiency, yield, and quality rates
* Month‑wise production and efficiency trend analysis
* Target vs produced quantity comparison
* Category‑wise rejection quantity analysis
* Factory‑wise lost minutes and production grades
* Shipment mode analysis with on‑time delivery tracking
* Interactive slicers for year, month, grade, and system (TMS / GMS)

## Key Visuals & Why They Were Used

### KPI Cards

Used to provide a high‑level snapshot of critical production and quality metrics for quick management review.

### Line Charts (Monthly Trends)

Used to track knitting output, efficiency, and fabric shrinkage over time, helping identify seasonal or operational fluctuations.

### Clustered & Stacked Column Charts

Used to compare target vs actual production and to analyze cutting quantity against marker efficiency across months.

### Bar Charts (Rejection by Category)

Helps identify product categories contributing most to quality rejection and wastage.

### Donut Chart (Factory‑wise Lost Minutes)

Visualizes downtime contribution by factory to prioritize improvement actions.

### Column Chart (Shipment Mode‑wise On‑Time Delivery)

Used to evaluate logistics performance across different shipment modes.

---

## Key Insights

* Production efficiency and output vary significantly by month
* Certain product categories contribute disproportionately to rejections
* Factory‑wise downtime has a strong impact on overall performance
* Shipment mode selection influences on‑time delivery outcomes

---

## Conclusion

This RMG Production Analytics Dashboard transforms complex manufacturing data into actionable insights. It demonstrates the practical application of Power BI in the apparel industry for improving efficiency, quality control, and operational decision‑making.
